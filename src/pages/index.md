I build software from the ground up using cool technologies and I love
tinkering with computers in general.

My current dream stack is made up of **JavaScript** (with **React**,
**Next.JS** and **fastify**), a solid data layer like **PostgreSQL** (maybe
with **Prisma** to query it) and all of this orchestrated with **Docker**
containers. My IDE is **Vim** and I manage source code with
**Git**(Hub|Lab).

I also write [short tech-focused articles](/tldr/), do
[Open Source](https://github.com/madx) stuff,
[paint miniatures](https://instagram.com/koleir), enjoy headbanging to some
[extreme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARI0XyTiips)
[metal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YODamIinCys)
and sometimes I even [tweet](https://twitter.com/madx).
